              Moodify started out as a group project, developed by a three-person team. Our main goal is to fulfill the need that many creative people
              have: to be visually and audibly stimulated so that inspiration and creation flows more easily. 
              Using the user's input, we give a customized selection of images and playlists. 
              We accomplished this by implementing a search bar that you can use for keywords, as well as dropdowns with different categories so you can
              easily find what you're looking for at the moment.
